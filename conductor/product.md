# Initial Concept
A simple web application with a React UI, API, and SQL database, optimized for mobile devices, to track dogs and their walks for compliance. The app will support comprehensive dog record management throughout their life cycle, including history before shelter arrival, name, health, behavior, preferences, returns and reasons, adoptions, medications, and daily walk history.
